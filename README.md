# WFBU - Webfaction Backup

I wanted to both automate the backups for all of my webapps on the Webfaction platform and teach myself python.  This is the work in progress to accomplish those things.  I am still learning Python so there are sure to be some horrifying things in here that, with any luck, will embarrass me months from now.  That said, feedback is always appreciated, as I aim to improve.
